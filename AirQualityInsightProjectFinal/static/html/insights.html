            <h3>Winter Pollution Spike</h3>
            <p>
              Air quality consistently worsens during winter months (November through February) across most regions.
              This is primarily due to increased heating needs, temperature inversions that trap pollutants,
              and in some regions, seasonal agricultural burning.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="insight-card">
            <h3>Summer Improvements</h3>
            <p>
              The months of June through August show significantly better air quality globally.
              Improved ventilation conditions, reduced heating emissions, and in some regions,
              monsoon rains that wash away pollutants contribute to this seasonal improvement.

          <div class="insight-card">
            <h3>Regional Variations</h3>
            <p>
              While the general pattern shows winter peaks in pollution, some regions like 
              Southeast Asia show different patterns due to factors such as seasonal forest fires
              and different monsoon timings.

            <h3>Economic Development Correlation</h3>
            <p>
              Analysis shows a notable correlation between economic development stage and air quality.
              Rapidly industrializing nations with less stringent environmental regulations tend to
              experience worse air quality compared to developed economies that have implemented
              more advanced emission control technologies.

            <h3>Population Density Impact</h3>
            <p>
              Countries with high population density, particularly in urban centers, show
              significantly higher pollution levels. The concentration of vehicle emissions,
              industrial activities, and energy production in limited geographic areas
              contributes to this pattern.

          <div class="insight-card">
            <h3>Geographic Factors</h3>
            <p>
              Countries with challenging geographical features like valley basins, surrounding
              mountains, or areas prone to temperature inversions face unique air quality challenges.
              These natural features can trap pollution and prevent dispersion, regardless of
              emission levels.

            <h3>WHO Guideline Compliance</h3>
            <p>
              Only a small fraction of monitored cities worldwide meet the WHO guideline of 5 μg/m³
              for annual average PM2.5 concentration. This highlights the global nature of the air
              quality challenge and the need for widespread improvements.

            <h3>Improvement Trends</h3>
            <p>
              Despite ongoing challenges, many regions have shown gradual improvement in air quality
              compared to baseline measurements from 2018. This suggests that pollution control
              measures, policy changes, and technological improvements are having positive effects.

            <h3>Climate Change Connection</h3>
            <p>
              Our analysis suggests a bidirectional relationship between air quality and climate change.
              While climate change can worsen air quality through increased wildfires and changed weather patterns,
              many of the sources of air pollutants are also major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.
